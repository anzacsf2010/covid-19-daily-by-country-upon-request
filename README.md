# covid-19-daily-by-country-upon-user-request
This is a small tool for querying daily confimed, recovered and deaths cases data for COVID-19 for any (reported) country based on user input.

The tool can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/anzacsf2010/covid-19-daily-by-country-upon-request/raw/master/covid19GUI.exe).

Suggestions and recommendations are welcome. 

Andy.
